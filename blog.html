		<h4>My first blog post</h4>
    <h6>November 16, 2018</h6>
		<p>This is my first blog post. I am currently working to figure out the issues with my website, and after I fix them I will continue to develop the pages. I plan to make wiki-style pages for most of the things I cover, especially the games and demos that don't have much documentation available about them. See you guys in the next blog post!
