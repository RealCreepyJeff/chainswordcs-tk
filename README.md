Resources for the website http://chainswordcs.tk/

HTML and CSS code, and images. File downloads will be hosted elsewhere.
Now also hosting some of the Fisher-Price iXL Learning System software (abandonware) playable in-browser!

Testing branch is for testing code before it's pushed to the site, but only sometimes.

I try to work on this when I can and when I feel like it. It's basically my go-to spot for documentation. I'll probably make a blog sometime to write about my "research" proper.
