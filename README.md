Resources for the website http://chainswordcs.tk/

HTML and CSS code, and images. File downloads will be hosted elsewhere.

Testing branch is for testing code before it's pushed to the site, but only sometimes.

I try to work on this when I can and when I feel like it, for now I will continue updating it until it has reached a state I'm satisfied with, then update only whenever necessary.

To Do:
iXL Stuff
-SWF and HTML files from system firmware and pc software
-SWF files for all games
-Better UI
-Try to port other features like photos, music, etc.
