  1. Navigate to the .WMA or .MP3   audio file that is stored on your computer.<br />
   
  <br />
  2. Select the audio file(s).   You can use the Control and the Shift Keys to select multiple files   simultaneously. <br />
  <br />
  3. Copy the audio into My Library. Once the handheld is   connected and turned on, transfer the audio from My Library to My   Handheld.<br />
  <br />
  Note: The handheld can play either .WMA or .MP3 audio files.   Audio files first need to be converted to one of these two compatible file   formats. <br />

  <a name="question1"><strong> How do I change the file format of my   songs so I can play them on the handheld?</strong></a><br />
  When you save songs from a CD, the   song file will be saved in the default format for your media player. To play on   the handheld, song files need to be saved as .WMA or .MP3 files. Below are   examples of how to change file formats on a few common media players.<br />
  <br />
  -   Windows Media Player®<br />
  The default format is Windows Media Audio (WMA), which   is compatible with the handheld. No change is necessary.<br />
  <br />
  If you do need   to adjust your file format in Windows Media Player®, go to Rip &gt; Format, and   select Windows Media Audio or MP3. <br />
  <br />
  - iTunes®<br />
  If you never adjusted   the default file format in iTunes®, you will need to change it to MP3 Encoder. <br />
  <br />
  To adjust your file format in iTunes, go to Edit &gt; Preferences. On   the General tab, select Import Settings. Then select MP3 Encoder. <br />
  <br />
  You can also change the file format of songs purchased through iTunes if those songs do not have restrictions applied to them, such as Digital Rights Management (DRM). For more information see iTunes Help.<br />
  </p>
<p><br />
  <a name="question2"><strong>Can I put   audio from sites such as iTunes® on the handheld?</strong></a><br />
  Songs that are not in a compatible file format, and/or are protected by Digital Rights Management (DRM) cannot be added to your handheld.</p>
<p>If the iTunes audio does not have DRM, you can convert the audio to MP3 inside iTunes. For more information see iTunes Help.</p>
<p>Then in the Computer Software, go to My Library, select the &quot;Import Audio from Computer&quot; button, navigate to the song file, and import the MP3 audio file.<br />
